## Writing a Play in Markdown.
It's awful. I don't recommend it. I'm only doing it because the alternatives
aren't much better. Maybe one day I'll build something better.

Tips:
* use the `<indent>`, `<bigindent>`, `<biggerindent>`, and `<biggestindent>` tags
in the markdown for spacing. It's nasty, blame markdown and my dismal CSS skills.
* To get lines to break you need 2 spaces at the end of each line.
