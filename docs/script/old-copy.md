_The stage is bare with the exception of 3 ladders (6' high or less) in the
upstage area. Attached to one of the ladders is a large crude wooden shield
that serves as a coat of arms._

**First Witch.** When shall we three meet again?  
	<indent>In thunder, lightning or in rain?</indent>  
**Second Witch.** When the hurly-burly's done,  
	<indent>When the battle's lost and won.</indent>  
**Third Witch.** That will be ere the set of sun.  
**First Witch.** Where the place?  
**Second Witch.** <bigindent>Upon the heath.</bigindent>  
**Third Witch.** There to meet with Macbeth.  
**All.** Fair is foul, and foul is fair.  
	<indent>Hover through the fog and filthy air.</indent>

_Music. Lights brighten. One of the witches rides upon the shoulders of a chorus
member. All the witches wear long flowing capes that create a sense of flight.
They run and swirl across the stage. They end up twirling and dancing in the
downstage area. War cries. In the upstage area the rest of the chorus enters the
stage from both sides. Battle scense. Several bodies are left on the ground and
remain there throughout the next scene. The witches "fly" to the backstage areas
and up the ladders where they remain whenever they are not directly involved in
the action. The chorus becomes the warriors of Duncan's camp. Ross and soldiers
are binding and interrogating Cawdor. Surgeons are tending to the wounded.
Duncan is reviewing things with Malcolm and Donalbain. [Donalbains's indent in
this scene was originally Lennox] Sergeant and another warrior who aids [him/her]
are in the downstage area._

**Duncan.** What bloody [man/one] is that?...  
**Malcolm.** <bigindent>This is the sergeant</bigindent>  
	<indent>Who ... fought </indent>  
	<indent>'Gainst my captivity. Hail brave friend! </indent>     
	<indent>Say to the King of the knowledge of the broil </indent>  
	<indent>As thou didst leave it.</indent>  
**Sergeant.**<bigindent>Doubtful it stood,</bigindent>  
	<indent>As two spent swimmers that do cling together</indent>
	<indent>And choke their art.  The merciless Macdonwald...</indent>  
	<indent>From the western isles...is supplied...But all's too weak.</indent>  
	<indent>For brave Macbeth...Disdaining fortune...carv'ed out his passage</indent>  
	<indent>Till he unseamed him from the nave to the chaps,</indent> 
	<indent>And fixed his head upon our battlements.</indent>  
**Duncan.** Oh, valiant Cousin!...    
**Sergeant.**<bigindent>...Mark, King of Scotland, mark.</bigindent>   
	<indent>No sooner justice had...</indent>  
	<indent>Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</indent>  
	<indent>But the norweyan lord, surveying vantage,</indent>  
	<indent>Began a fresh assault.</indent>  
**Duncan.**<bigindent>Dismayed not this</bigindent>  
	<indent>Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?</indent>  
**Sergeant.**<bigindent><indent><indent>Yes,</indent></indent></bigindent>  
	<indent>As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion...</indent>  
**Duncan.** So well thy words become the as thy wounds.  
	<indent>They smack of honor both. Go get [him/her] surgeons.</indent>  
	<indent>Who comes here?</indent>   

_Enter Ross with guards and a bound Cawdor_

**Malcolm.** <bigindent>The worthy thane of Ross.</bigindent>  
**Ross.** <biggerindent>God save the King!</biggerindent>  
**Duncan.** Whence camest though, worth Thane?  
**Ross.** <biggestindent>From Fife, great King,</biggestindent> 
	<indent>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</indent>  
	<indent>And fan our people cold</indent>  
	<indent>Norway himself, with terrible numbers,</indent>  
	<indent>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor</indent>  
	<indent>The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict...</indent>  
	<bigindent>And to conclude,</bigindent>  
	<indent>The victory fell on us.</indent> 
**Duncan.**<bigindent>Great Happiness!...</bigindent>  
	<indent>No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive</indent>  
	<indent>Our bosom interest. Go pronounce [his/her] present death,</indent>  
	<indent>And with [his/her] former title greet Macbeth</indent>  
**Ross.** I'll see it done.  
**Duncan.** What [he/she] hath lost, noble Macbeth has won...  

_All exit except Duncain, Malcolm, and Donalbain. [This line came from a later
scene which was cut]_

**Duncan.**<biggerindent>There's no art</biggerindent>  
	<indent>To find the mind's construction in the face.</indent>  
	<indent>[He/She] was a [gentleman/valiant thane] on whom I build</indent>   
	<indent>An absolute trust.</indent> 

_Duncan, Malcolm, and Donalbain exit into the chorus, which becomes evil spirits.
The rest of the chorus lifts the witches above the "fog" to create a floating effect.
When Macbeth and Banquo enter, this scene will employ an off stage focus._

**All.** _Rapping_ The weird sisters, hand in hand,  
	<indent>Posters of the sea and land,</indent>  
	<indent>Thus do go about, about.</indent>  
	<indent>Thrice to thine and thrice to mine,</indent>  
	<indent>And thrice again, to make up nine.</indent>  
	<indent>Peace! The charm's wound up.</indent> 

_Enter Macbeth and Banquo_

**Macbeth.** So foul and fair a day I have not seen.  
**Banquo.** How far is 't called to Forres? What are these...  
	<indent>That look not like inhabitants o' the earth</indent>  
	<indent>And yet are on 't?</indent>  
**Macbeth.**<bigindent>Speak if you can. What are you?</bigindent>  
**First Witch.** All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!  
**Second Witch.** All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!  
**Third Witch.** All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!  
**Banquo.** Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear  
	<indent>Things that do sound fair?...</indent>  
	<indent>If you can look into the seeds of time</indent>  
	<indent>And say which grain will grow and which will not,</indent>  
	<indent>Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear</indent>  
	<indent>Your favors nor your hate.</indent>  
**First Witch.** Hail  
**Second Witch.** Hail  
**Third Witch.** Hail  
**First Witch.** Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.  
**Second Witch.** Not so happy, yet much happier.  
**Third Witch.** Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none  
	<indent>So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</indent>  
**First Witch.** Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!  

_The chorus and witches return to the upstage area and freeze into grotesque shapes._

**Macbeth.** Stay you imperfect speakers, tell me more  
	<biggerindent> ... Speak, I charge you.</biggerindent>  
**Banquo.** The earth has bubbles, as the water has,
	<indent>And these are of them. Whither are they vanished?</indent>  
**Macbeth.** Into the air, and what seemed corporal melted  
**Banquo.** Were such things here as we do speak about?  
    <indent>Or have we eaten on the insane root</indent>  
    <indent>That takes the reason prisoner?</indent>  
**Macbeth.** Your children shall be kings.  
**Banquo.** <biggerindent> You shall be King. </biggerindent>  
**Macbeth.** And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?  
**Banquo.** To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?  

_Enter Ross and another thane. [Thane was originally Angus]_  

**Ross.** The king hath happily received, Macbeth,  
    <indent>The news of thy success...</indent>  
**Thane.** <biggerindent> We are sent</biggerindent>  
    <indent>To give thee, from our royal master, thanks,</indent>  
    <indent>Only to herald thee into his sight,</indent>  
    <indent>Not pay thee.</indent>  
**Ross.** And for an earnest of a greater honor,
    <indent>He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.</indent>  
    <indent>In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane!</indent>  
    <indent>For it is thine.</indent>  
**Banquo.**<indent>What, can the Devel speak true?</indent>  
**Macbeth.** The Thane of Caword lives. Why do you dress me  
    <indent> In borrowed robes?</indent>  
**Thane.** <indent> Who was the Thane lives yet:</indent>  
    <indent>But under heavy judgement bears that life</indent>  
    <indent>Which he deserves to lose...</indent>  
    <indent>Treasons capital, confessed and proved,</indent>  
    <indent>Have overthrown him...</indent>  
**Macbeth.** <indent>_Aside_ Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor.</indent>  
    <indent>The greatest is behind. _To Ross and Thane_ Thanks for your pains</indent>  
    <indent>_Aside to Banquo_ Do you not hope your children will be kings, </indent>
    <indent>When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me</indent>  
    <indent>Promised no less to them?</indent>  
**Banquo.**<biggerindent>That trusted home,</biggerindent>  
    <indent>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,</indent>  
    <indent>Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange</indent>  
    <indent>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,</indent>  
    <indent>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,</indent>  
    <indent>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's </indent>  
    <indent>In deepest consequence.</indent>  
**Macbeth.** ...Think upon what hat chanced, and at more time,  
    <indent>The interim having weighed it, let us speak</indent>  
    <indent>Our free hearts each to the other.</indent>  
**Banquo.**<biggerindent> Very gladly, </biggerindent>  
**Macbeth.** Till then, enough. Come friends.  

_All freeze except Macbeth who turns to an offstage focus. The chorus forms
the shapes of arches. Lady Macbeth emerges through the arches as a dark and
evil cave, reading a letter. [Originally, the entire letter was read by
Lady Macbeth]_

**Macbeth.** "...Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King,
	<indent>who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor,' by which title, before these weird sisters</indent>
	<indent>saluted me, and with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I thought good to</indent>
	<indent>deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou  mightest not lose the dues</indent>
	<indent>of rejoicing, by being ignorant of...</indent>  
**Lady Macbeth.** ...that though mightest not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of
	<indent>what greatness is promised thee."</indent>  
	<indent>Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be</indent>
	<indent>What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.</indent>
	<indent>It is too full o' the milk of human kindness</indent>  
	<indent>To catch the nearest way...</indent>
<br><br>_Enter a Messenger._<br><br>
	<biggestindent>What is your tidings?</biggestindent>  
**Messenger.** The King comes here tonight.  
**Lady Macbeth.**<biggestindent>Thou'rt mad to say it</biggestindent>
	<indent>Is not thy master with him? Who, were 't so,</indent>
	<indent>Would have informed for preparation.</indent>  
**Messenger.** So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming.
	<indent>One of my fellows had the speed of him...</indent>  
**Lady Macbeth.** He brings great news
<br><br>_Exit Messenger_<br><br>
	<biggerindent>The raven himself is hoarse</biggerindent>  
	<indent>That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan</indent>  
	<indent>Under my battlements.</indent>
<br><br>_During the remainder of this speech the Chorus becomes Evil Spirits who close in and
surround Lady Macbeth, eventually levitating her, creating the ecstatic feeling of body
surfing._<br><br>
	<biggestindent>Come, you sprits</biggestindent>
	<indent>That tend on mortal thoughs, Unsex me here,</indent>
	<indent>And fill me, from the crown to the toe, topfull</indent>
	<indent>Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,</indent>
	<indent>Stop up the access and passage to remorse...</indent>
	<biggerindent>Come to my woman's breasts,</biggerindent>
	<indent>And take my milk for gall... Come, thick night,</indent>
	<indent>And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of Hell,</indent>
	<indent>That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</indent>
	Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
	To cry "Hold, hold!"
_Enter Macbeth. The Chorus returns to being arches, guards etc._
	Great Glamis! Worthy Cawdor!
	Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
	Thy letters have transported me beyond
	This ignorant present, and I feel now
	The future in the instant
**Macbeth.**My dearest love,
	Duncan comes here tonight.
**Lady Macbeth.** And when goes hence?
**Macbeth.** Tomorrow, as [he/she] purposes.
**Lady Macbeth.** Oh, never
	Shall sun that morrow see!
	Your face, my Thane, is a book where men
	May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
	Looke the time...Look like the innocent flower
	But be the serpent under 't. [He/She] that's coming
	Must be provided for. And you shall put
	This night's great business into my dispatch...
**Macbeth.** We shall speak further
**Lady Macbeth.** Only look up clear.
	To alter favor ever is to fear.
	Leave all the rest to me.

_Macbeth moves to downstage area. Lights dim. Music. In upstage area we see Lady
Macbeth greeting and entertaining Duncan. The Chorus becomes other guests at the
feast. They are dancing, entertaining, etc. Shortly after Lady Macbeth enters downstage
area, they freeze and lights dim on them_

**Macbeth.** ...[He's/She's] here in double trust.
	First, as I am [his/her] kinsman and [his/her] subject,
	Strong both against the deed. This as [his/her] host,
	Who should against [his/her] murderer shut the door,
	Not bear the knife myself. Besides, ...I have no spur
	To prick the sides of my intent, but only
	Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
	And falls on the other.

_Lady Macbeth enters_

**Lady Macbeth.* ... Why have you left the chamber?
**Macbeth.** Hath [he/she] asked for me?
**Lady Macbeth.**		Know you not [he/she] has?
**Macbeth.** We will proceed no further in this business.
	[He/She] hath honored me of late, and I have bought
	Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
	Which should be worn now in their newest gloss,
	Not cast aside so soon.
**Lady Macbeth.**		...Art thou afeared
	To be the same in thine own act and valor
	As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou...
	...live a coward in thine own esteem,
	Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would,"
	Like the poor cat i' the adage?
**Macbeth.**			Prithee, peace.
	I dare do all that may become a man.
	Who dares do more is none.
**Lady Macbeth.** When you durst do it, then you were a man...
	...I have given suck, and know
	How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me.
	I would, while it was smiling in my face,
	Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums
	And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you
	Have done to this.
**Macbeth.**		If we should fail?
**Lady Macbeth.**				We fail!
	But screw your courage to the sticking-place
	And we'll not fail.

_We see drunken warriors leaving the party._

	When Duncan is asleep...
	...[his/her] two chamberlains
	Will I with wine and wassail so convince
	That memory, the warder of the brain,
	Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
	A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep.
	What cannot you and I perform upon
	The ungarded Duncan? What not put upon
	[His/Her] spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
	Of our great quell?
**Macbeth.** 		...Will it not be received
	When we have marked with blood those sleepy two
	Of [his/her] own chamber and used their very daggers,
	That they have done 't?
**Lady Macbeth.**	Who dares receive it other...?
**Macbeth.**	I am settled, and bend up
	Each corporal agent to this terrible feat...

_Macbeth and Lady Macbeth return to the party. Very brief blackout. Lights return.
Macbeth with a servant in the downstage area. Chorus has become serpentine creature
waving many daggers.

**Macbeth.** Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
	She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
	Is this a dagger which I see before me,
	The handle toward my hand? ...Or art though but
	A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
	Proceeding from the heat-oppress'ed brain?
								...There's no such thing.
	It is this bloody business which informs
	Thus to mine eyes...

_a bell rings_

	I go and it is done. The bell invites me.
	Hear it not Duncan, for it is a knell
	That summons thee to Heaven, or to Hell.

_Macbeth enters the "cave" of the Chorus, where during Lady Macbeth's speech, we
catch slight glimpses of the crime. Lady Macbeth emerges.

**Lady Macbeth.** That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold,
	What hath quenched them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace!
	It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman,
	Which gives the stern'st good night. He is about it.
	The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
	Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged their possets,
	That death and nature do contend about them,
	Whether they live or die.
**Macbeth** _within_		Who's there? What, ho!
**Lady Macbeth.** Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
	And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
	Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready,
	He could not miss 'em. Had [he/she] not resembled
	My [father/mother] as [he/she] slept, I had done't.

_enter Macbeth._

	My Husband!
**Macbeth.** I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
**Lady Macbeth.** I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
	Did not you speak?
**Macbeth** When?
**Lady Macbeth.** Now.
**Macbeth.** As I descended?
**Lady Macbeth.** Aye.
**Macbeth.** Hark!
	Who lies i' the second chamber?
**Lady Macbeth.** Donalbain.

_Looking on his hands._

**Macbeth.** This is a sorry sight.
**Lady Macbeth.** A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
**Macbeth.** ...Methought I heard a voice cry "Sleep no more!
	Macbeth doth murder sleep" - the innocent sleep,
	Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care...
**Lady Macbeth.** What do you mean?
**Macbeth.** Still it cried "Sleep no more!" to all the house.
	"Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor
	Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more."
**Lady Macbeth.** Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy Thane,
	You do unbend your noble strength to think
	So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
	And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
	Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
	They must lie there. Go carry them, and smear
	The sleepy grooms with the blood.
**Macbeth.** I'll go no more.
	I am afraid to think what I have done,
	Look on 't again I dare not.
**Lady Macbeth.** Infirm of purpose!
	Give me the daggers...
	If he do bleed,
	I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
	For it must seem their guilt.

_Lady Macbeth exists into the Chorus. The sound of Knocking._

**Macbeth.** Whence is that knocking?
