# William Shakespeare's Macbeth

This is a One-Act play adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth by
Jim Devenport. To my knowledge this play has been performed twice (used in two
One-Act seasons. The amount of times it was performed during those seasons is
unknown) at Needville High School while Jim was teaching there, the most recent
time being in the spring of 2010. I had the pleasure of being in the cast in 
2010.

This adaptation will stay as written and will not accept pull requests out of
respect to its original adapter. This site contains the full version of the
adaptation as well as the cut that I performed in 2010. If you choose to use
this script, do a different cut and would like to share please contact me
so that I can put your cut on the webpage.

The forward from the author has suggestions for casting and stage design. 
Creating your own world for this play can be a lot of fun for your students
so I highly recommend following the instructions in the forward. I edited the 
forward for grammar issues, but the words there are 100% Devenport. He was a
breaker of rules so, while he gives suggestions as to the gender of certain
characters, nothing would delight him more than to see that turned on his head.
