_Forward and instructions written by Jim Devenport, edited by Mason Egger_

This adaptation of _Macbeth_ is designed specifically for young performers. It
calls for a great deal of physical acting on the part of all performers. 
Creating a _Lord of the Flies_ or _Jeremiah_ (i.e. youthful and barbarous)
reality is appropriate for this particular adaptation. The only character that
has to be of an older age is Duncan, and he can be portrayed in his young
thirties. If the director chooses to age the characters, it should be done with
only costume pieces, and the voice and body of the actor/actress. A full
costume and make-up job to create age for a single character is simply not
practical for this adaptation. Stylized make-up to create another world for
the play is, however, appropriate if the director so chooses. A contemporary
choice of music is also acceptable. 

In this adaptatin, no attempt should be made to costume the show in the 11th
century Scottish style, nor in the more traditional Elizabethan style. It 
should be costumed as in a long forgotten past or post-apocalyptic future.
At any rate, every attempt should be made to create a world, unique to this
play. This is, for the most part, a gender-blind version. With the exception
of Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Macduff, and Lady Macduff, the sex of the
actor/actress playing the part is of no consequence. The emphasis should be on
the concepts of Warrior, Ruler, Parent, Child, or Evil rather than sex of the
actor. Not only does this provide the director with a great deal of flexibility
in casting, it also provides more opportunity for young actresses to participate
and receive the eductational benefits of performing Shakespeare. Costuming
should, therefore, be somewhat uniform and unisexual. Only the smallest
of costume pieces should be used to separate one character from another when
an actor/actress is playing multiple parts.

For most of the smaller roles such as Lennox, Angus and Ross etc. who appear
in more than once scene, the actor playing the part should concentrate on the
function his or her character plays in a scene rather than trying to develop
the character across the entire play. The length of the cutting simply makes
such a development impossible. For the most part, in this adaptation the names
of these characters are replaced with generic titles such as Thane, Guest and 
Servant etc., which provides the director with a greator flexibility in casting. 

This is a choral or company ensemble adaptation designed for a company of about
twelve to fifteen actors. Except for the briefest moments, no one in the cast
leaves the stage; for the most part, characters emerge from and return to the
chorus. The size of the company is also quite flexible. By cutting the 
nonverbal battle scenes; making the actors/actresses who play the witches more
a part of the main chorus ensemble; and making slight adjustments to the stage
directions, this adaptation could be performed by as few as eight to ten
performers.

This is, however, and adaptation, not an attempted rewrite. With the exception
of [he/she] or [him/her] and slight adjustments when the gender of the
character has been changed, the only changes in the language have been cuts. 
There have been a few nonverbal scense added to make the play more accessible
to those who may not be familiar with the story line. In a few instances, lines
have been slightly rearranged in order to shorten the play to a one-act.

In its present form, this adaptation is probably too long for festival and UIL
purposes. Further line to line cuts, and the removal of whole scense will 
doubtlessly be necessary to stay within the rules governing UIL and many
festivals.

I may choose to employ fog machines or hazers, portable lights, and soft goods.
All use of such items will stay within the UIL rules governing them.
