_The stage is bare with the exception of 3 ladders (6' high or less) in the
upstage area. Attached to one of the ladders is a large crude wooden shield
that serves as a coat of arms._

**First Witch.** When shall we three meet again?  
	<indent>In thunder, lightning or in rain?</indent>  
**Second Witch.** When the hurly-burly's done,  
	<indent>When the battle's lost and won.</indent>  
**Third Witch.** That will be ere the set of sun.  
**First Witch.** Where the place?  
**Second Witch.** <bigindent>Upon the heath.</bigindent>  
**Third Witch.** There to meet with Macbeth.  
**All.** Fair is foul, and foul is fair.  
	<indent>Hover through the fog and filthy air.</indent>

_Music. Lights brighten. One of the witches rides upon the shoulders of a chorus
member. All the witches wear long flowing capes that create a sense of flight.
They run and swirl across the stage. They end up twirling and dancing in the
downstage area. War cries. In the upstage area the rest of the chorus enters the
stage from both sides. Battle scense. Several bodies are left on the ground and
remain there throughout the next scene. The witches "fly" to the backstage areas
and up the ladders where they remain whenever they are not directly involved in
the action. The chorus becomes the warriors of Duncan's camp. Ross and soldiers
are binding and interrogating Cawdor. Surgeons are tending to the wounded.
Duncan is reviewing things with Malcolm and Donalbain. [Donalbains's indent in
this scene was originally Lennox] Sergeant and another warrior who aids [him/her]
are in the downstage area._

**Duncan.** What bloody [man/one] is that?...  
**Malcolm.** <bigindent>This is the sergeant</bigindent>  
	<indent>Who ... fought </indent>  
	<indent>'Gainst my captivity. Hail brave friend! </indent>     
	<indent>Say to the King of the knowledge of the broil </indent>  
	<indent>As thou didst leave it.</indent>  
**Sergeant.**<bigindent>Doubtful it stood,</bigindent>  
	<indent>As two spent swimmers that do cling together</indent>
	<indent>And choke their art.  The merciless Macdonwald...</indent>  
	<indent>From the western isles...is supplied...But all's too weak.</indent>  
	<indent>For brave Macbeth...Disdaining fortune...carv'ed out his passage</indent>  
	<indent>Till he unseamed him from the nave to the chaps,</indent> 
	<indent>And fixed his head upon our battlements.</indent>  
**Duncan.** Oh, valiant Cousin!...    
**Sergeant.**<bigindent>...Mark, King of Scotland, mark.</bigindent>   
	<indent>No sooner justice had...</indent>  
	<indent>Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</indent>  
	<indent>But the norweyan lord, surveying vantage,</indent>  
	<indent>Began a fresh assault.</indent>  
**Duncan.**<bigindent>Dismayed not this</bigindent>  
	<indent>Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?</indent>  
**Sergeant.**<bigindent><indent><indent>Yes,</indent></indent></bigindent>  
	<indent>As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion...</indent>  
**Duncan.** So well thy words become the as thy wounds.  
	<indent>They smack of honor both. Go get [him/her] surgeons.</indent>  
	<indent>Who comes here?</indent>   

_Enter Ross with guards and a bound Cawdor_

**Malcolm.** <bigindent>The worthy thane of Ross.</bigindent>  
**Ross.** <biggerindent>God save the King!</biggerindent>  
**Duncan.** Whence camest though, worth Thane?  
**Ross.** <biggestindent>From Fife, great King,</biggestindent> 
	<indent>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</indent>  
	<indent>And fan our people cold</indent>  
	<indent>Norway himself, with terrible numbers,</indent>  
	<indent>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor</indent>  
	<indent>The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict...</indent>  
	<bigindent>And to conclude,</bigindent>  
	<indent>The victory fell on us.</indent> 
**Duncan.**<bigindent>Great Happiness!...</bigindent>  
	<indent>No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive</indent>  
	<indent>Our bosom interest. Go pronounce [his/her] present death,</indent>  
	<indent>And with [his/her] former title greet Macbeth</indent>  
**Ross.** I'll see it done.  
**Duncan.** What [he/she] hath lost, noble Macbeth has won...  

_All exit except Duncain, Malcolm, and Donalbain. [This line came from a later
scene which was cut]_

**Duncan.**<biggerindent>There's no art</biggerindent>  
	<indent>To find the mind's construction in the face.</indent>  
	<indent>[He/She] was a [gentleman/valiant thane] on whom I build</indent>   
	<indent>An absolute trust.</indent> 

_Duncan, Malcolm, and Donalbain exit into the chorus, which becomes evil spirits.
The rest of the chorus lifts the witches above the "fog" to create a floating effect.
When Macbeth and Banquo enter, this scene will employ an off stage focus._

**All.** _Rapping_ The weird sisters, hand in hand,  
	<indent>Posters of the sea and land,</indent>  
	<indent>Thus do go about, about.</indent>  
	<indent>Thrice to thine and thrice to mine,</indent>  
	<indent>And thrice again, to make up nine.</indent>  
	<indent>Peace! The charm's wound up.</indent> 

_Enter Macbeth and Banquo_

**Macbeth.** So foul and fair a day I have not seen.  
**Banquo.** How far is 't called to Forres? What are these...  
	<indent>That look not like inhabitants o' the earth</indent>  
	<indent>And yet are on 't?</indent>  
**Macbeth.**<bigindent>Speak if you can. What are you?</bigindent>  
**First Witch.** All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!  
**Second Witch.** All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!  
**Third Witch.** All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!  
**Banquo.** Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear  
	<indent>Things that do sound fair?...</indent>  
	<indent>If you can look into the seeds of time</indent>  
	<indent>And say which grain will grow and which will not,</indent>  
	<indent>Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear</indent>  
	<indent>Your favors nor your hate.</indent>  
**First Witch.** Hail  
**Second Witch.** Hail  
**Third Witch.** Hail  
**First Witch.** Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.  
**Second Witch.** Not so happy, yet much happier.  
**Third Witch.** Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none  
	<indent>So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</indent>  
**First Witch.** Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!  

_The chorus and witches return to the upstage area and freeze into grotesque shapes._

**Macbeth.**Stay you imperfect speakers, tell me more  
	<biggerindent> ... Speak, I charge you.</biggerindent>  
**Banquo.** The earth has bubbles, as the water has,
	<indent>And these are of them. Whither are they vanished?</indent>
